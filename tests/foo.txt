Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece
and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,
white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled
back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested
thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred
with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point
home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the
velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.sdf
